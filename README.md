Myvim
=====

This is my vim editor otimized for python code.

You need only to do it in your $HOME directory:

$ git clone https://github.com/ruhan/myvim.git .vim
$ cd .vim
$ git submodule init
$ git submodule 
$ ln -s $HOME/.vim/.vimrc $HOME/.vimrc

That's it! Enjoy your new editor!

* For use the vim-powerline you will need a little more work, go to 
its remository and do your work.
